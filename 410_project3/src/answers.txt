1. How do you determine the number of threads you should
	launch to realistically test your application?
	
There comes a point after the minimum execution time of the 
program where the execution time will begin to increase (law
of diminishing returns).
	
	
2. If you are launching several threads, under what
	circumstances would these threads not run parallel
	in a modern processor?
